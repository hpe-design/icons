# HPE Simple Icons

Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a set of bespoke icons classified as "simple" for use as glyphs or actionable elements for your app or website designs. Following the brand esthetic, all icons use a stroke based style, while social icons for brands like Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn adhere to their brands style.
